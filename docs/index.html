									<h2>Project Overview</h2>
								</header>
								
								<section>
									<p>
										The New Class Search aims to be an application that redesigns the University of Nevada, Reno’s 
										class search system with a modern and responsive web application. The current system is complex 
										to navigate, text-heavy, and challenging to use for many students. This project aims to develop 
										a better system for searching for courses, a digital planner, and resources to learn about UNR 
										degree programs. Students can find course information (such as the building, time, enrollment 
										capacity, etc) in an easier and cleaner manner.
									</p>
									<p>
										This project is made for the whole student body of UNR, as well as staff such as advisors and 
										professors. Not only will this project help with searching for courses, it will also provide a 
										way for professors to upload course syllabi, and also a way for advisors to upload flowcharts 
										for students to track their progress of their degree better.
									</p>
									<p>
										Overall, our main goal is to revolutionize the way UNR students can research what courses to 
										take next. We hope to make this experience easier and more enjoyable without needing to go 
										through the burden of using an outdated and unintuitive application. With the New Class Search, 
										looking for courses will be cleaner and better than ever.

										<b>Interaction design: Beyond human-computer interaction, 3rd Edition</b><br>
										This book teaches essential skills for designing interactive products across multiple disciplines from web design and to mobile devices.  The textbook covers HCI principles and shows how to apply them in real-word design and explores how technology enhances communication and work, while addressing technical, social, and ethical considerations. The book includes current examples of Web 2.0, and mobile devices, which fundamentally changed how people interact with digital systems.<br>

										<b>Web Design Dilemma: A Comprehensive Guide to Adaptive and Responsive Design</b><br>
										This article examines the critical choice between Adaptive Web Design (AWD) and Responsive Web Design (RWD) methodologies in modern web development. The study analyzes how web design approaches must evolve to keep pace with rapidly changing device ecosystems and screen resolutions. The articles provide a comparative analysis of both design methodologies, exploring their individual strengths and weaknesses through development complexity, user experience, and device adaptability considerations.<br>
