# New Class Search
This project is intended to redesign the University of Nevada, Reno’s current course search, which is complex to navigate and text heavy. The previous system forced students to rely on the course catalog and use the system mainly for enrollment, which limited the ability to browse and discover new classes. To address this, we developed a prototype that supports a more flexible and intuitive search experience, allowing users to pick and choose search criteria without needing a specific course in mind. The prototype includes basic account creation and login functionality while also providing a functioning course search with filters for course title, instructor, and other key criteria. This allows students to browse and find courses more efficiently than the previous system. The application also uses accurate course data to ensure reliable results and follows UI/UX principles to create an easy and intuitive navigation experience.
