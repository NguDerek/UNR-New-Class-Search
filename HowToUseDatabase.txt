1.) copy and paste neon connection link into terminal (any directory)
Note: make sure its NCS_db NOT neon_db
    a.) copy + paste normally                           # mac/linux
    b.) copy + paste BUT change single '' to double ""  # windows
    so terminal would have psql 'string' or psql "string" and Enter command
2.) You are already connected to NCS_db with con string so no need for /c NCS_db
3.) Do the SQL statement now:
    Example:
        1.) BEGIN;
        2.) INSERT INTO table (col1, col2, etc.) 
            VALUES(val1, val2, etc.);
        3.) COMMIT; 
        Note: COMMIT != git commit -> INSTEAD its = git push
4.) Undo a commit you messed up or don't want 
    1.) ROLLBACK;
Thats it! just change SQL statements accordingly

Note: Begin and commit not needed but HIGHLY reccommended for standard practice
- otherwise each single SQL statement line will commit INDEPENDENTLY
- that makes rollbacks more annoying and its better to keep logic GROUPED
